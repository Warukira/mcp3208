# Arduino library for MCP3208/3204 ADC

This library provides a library to communicate with the MCP3208/3204 ADC.

The library is implemented for the 8 channel (MCP3208) version but is fully
compatible with the 4 channel (MCP3204) version.

When used with the 4 channel version the working channels are limited to
the first 4 single channels (SINGLE_0-4) and the first 2 differential
channels (DIFF_0-1PN/NP).
